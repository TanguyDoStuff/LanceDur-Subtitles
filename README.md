# ![Ankama's Lance Dur Subtitles](logo.png)
Here's some subtitle files (.srt) for Ankama's animated webserie [Lance Dur](https://animationdigitalnetwork.fr/video/lance-dur)!

## How to use these files?
I recommend to use a subtitle web browser extension, such as [Substital](https://substital.com/), which add the subtitles at the bottom of the video.
Install the extension, then go on the episode you want to watch, and do the following:

1. Click on the extention
2. Select the video
3. Drag and drop the subtitle file

It will apply the subtitles that you downloaded here.

## Why make these subtitles?
Well, I really loved this small series and wanted to share it to a lot of people, but I couldn't find any English subtitles or dub! If something you need doesn't exist, make it yourself!
