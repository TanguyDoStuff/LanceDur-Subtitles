# ![Ankama's Lance Dur Subtitles](logo.png)
Here's some subtitle files (.srt) for Ankama's animated webserie [Lance Dur](https://animationdigitalnetwork.fr/video/lance-dur)!

## How to use these files?
You can use any video media players which support adding custom .srt files, such as [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).
On VLC, you can add these subtitles by opening the video file of a Lance Dur episode, and then going to

> **Subtitles -> Add Subtitles File...**

Will let you add the subtitle file you downloaded here.

## Why make these subtitles?
Well, I really loved this small series and wanted to share it to a lot of people, but I couldn't find any English subtitles or dub! If something you need doesn't exist, make it yourself!
