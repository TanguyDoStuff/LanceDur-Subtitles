# ![Ankama's Lance Dur Subtitles](logo.png)
Here's some subtitle files (.srt) for Ankama's animated webserie [Lance Dur](https://animationdigitalnetwork.fr/video/lance-dur)!

## How to use these files?
I recommend to use a subtitle web browser extension, such as [Substital](https://substital.com/), which add the subtitles at the bottom of the video.
Install the extension, then go on the episode you want to watch, and do the following:

1. Click on the extention
2. Select the video
3. Drag and drop the subtitle file

It will apply the subtitles that you downloaded here.

## Why make these subtitles?
Well, I really loved this small series and wanted to share it to a lot of people, but I couldn't find any English subtitles or dub! If something you need doesn't exist, make it yourself!

## Where are the 3 last episodes?
So, before I could finish, [Ankama Studio officially released a English Dub, but also subtitles in french, english, spanish, german and portuguese!](https://www.wakfu.com/en/forum/193-news/243926-lance-dur-all) So there isn't really a reason for me to continue doing it. I recommend anyone interested into the serie to watch it on the [Ankama Launcher](https://www.ankama.com/en/launcher), being avaliable as long as you have a Dofus or Wakfu subscription!

Of course, you can still edit errors, make more translations or add the missing episodes using pull requests, I would gladly merge them with no problem!
