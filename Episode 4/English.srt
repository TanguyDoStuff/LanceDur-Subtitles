1
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:26,847
No... No, not this...

2
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:28,163
Oh no...

3
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:31,222
Agard.

4
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:32,854
What have you done?

5
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:54,561
No... It's starting again...

6
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:57,483
What is that smell?

7
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:00,096
The smell... of death.

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,120
Ah congrats, Chaille!

9
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:04,144
Real death, Biste!

10
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:05,674
We woke up death!

11
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:08,248
We need to leave, quickly!

12
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:12,178
What is happening?

13
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:13,389
-What is happening?

14
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:16,858
What is happening is that we're in trouble, son.

15
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:20,670
The gem! That is what woke it up Cadence!

16
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:22,229
Throw it away!

17
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:42,893
What have I done?

18
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:46,191
Father, Mouche...

19
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:47,893
What have I done?

20
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:52,484
After all these years, it's still here.

21
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,523
Demons never get old.

22
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:01,406
And we couldn't do anything back then.

23
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,257
The armor is immuned to magic!

24
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:16,281
I woke up this demon...

25
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:18,897
-I woke up this demon... Father!

26
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,265
Enough!

27
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:22,289
All we have to do now is run away.

28
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:25,171
No.

29
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:28,218
I have a revenge to take on this trash!

30
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,945
I'm going to smash it!

31
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,535
Nothing, Biste. We retreat!

32
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,913
We're all going to die!

33
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:38,039
I can't believe it, you want to flee? After what it has done to Mouche?

34
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:41,046
The worse is coming, big girl.

35
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:43,667
You don't want that for Mouche.

36
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:45,878
Or the kid you're carrying.

37
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:46,768
What?

38
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,628
Wh-What are you saying, Chaille. I-I'm not...

39
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,124
The exit, Chaille. Quick!

40
00:02:57,941 --> 00:02:59,972
Yes, the pure air!

41
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,589
Agard, this is not the time to hang around!

42
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:15,409
The air...

43
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,237
... Is less foul-smelling here.

44
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:19,624
Guys! It's over here! Straight ahead!

45
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:22,495
AWOOO!

46
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,342
I found the exit again! Quick!

47
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,390
We're almost there! Come on! Come on! Come on!

48
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,089
Woah!

49
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:47,417
Okay, so it isn't over here!

50
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,203
Chaille! What the heck are you doing?

51
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,530
Let me mark the bad tracks!

52
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,370
I hear it come closer!

53
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:15,264
Chaille, so, the exit? Where is it?

54
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,385
Here, we're almost there.

55
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:29,533
But be careful where you put your paws.

56
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:58,385
AAAAAAAAAAH!

57
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:09,279
AAAH!

58
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:10,599
I don't want to die!

59
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:12,310
Not like that! AAAAH!

60
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,888
Pull me, father!

61
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:17,060
Oh, young people, you all never listen!

62
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:21,928
You need to be more careful, my son.

63
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:24,092
I know father. Sorry father.

64
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:38,385
The exit! The zaap!

65
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,471
Here! Right ahead!

66
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:42,991
Here! Right ahead!

67
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:44,065
Come on!

68
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:00,209
Come on! Come on! Faster!

69
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:11,716
Cadence? Why are you staying back?

70
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,731
Cadence!

71
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,548
Chaille, what are you doing?

72
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,797
Lance...

73
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:26,681
Lance... It's my time...

74
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:28,051
I know...

75
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:31,223
Here... As a hero...

76
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:35,470
Leave me... Now... My friends...

77
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:36,923
Leave...

78
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,018
My friends, leave.

79
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:42,815
All these years were amazing.

80
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,839
I don't regret anything.

81
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:49,546
CADENCE!!

82
00:07:13,856 --> 00:07:16,301
NOOOOOO!!!

83
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,018
It's over... Old friend...

84
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:00,667
I will save you... Some time...

85
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:03,385
What a dog's life, heh?

86
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:10,065
Hah! That... You said it...

87
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:12,647
Chaille, I-

88
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:14,671
It's over, son.

89
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,252
Let's let him leave the way he wants.

90
00:08:45,803 --> 00:08:48,823
Come on... Come closer... Demon...

91
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,858
I got new toys... Since the last time...

92
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:05,272
And don't think... I will let you pass that easily!

93
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:11,885
COME ON! COME FORWARD, DEMON! LET'S END THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL, YOU AND ME!

94
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:13,909
Aah-
