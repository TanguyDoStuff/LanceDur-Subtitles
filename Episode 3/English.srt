1
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:19,902
Burnt deads

2
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,965
He he he he... Ha ha ha ha!

3
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:15,836
*Cough*

4
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:27,495
Eh... It's good?

5
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:29,214
Have we arrived?

6
00:01:29,238 --> 00:01:32,104
Well yeah. What have you thought, kid?

7
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:34,420
And the horrible mermaids, where are they?

8
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:35,272
Dead.

9
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:38,381
And the giant storm which smashed us against rocks?

10
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:39,607
Oh, it happens often.

11
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:41,867
And the boat? Did-
-Enough, Agard!

12
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:46,151
And would it have killed you to take two minutes to warn me?

13
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:49,244
*Laughs*

14
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:50,931
The patience of youth...

15
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:54,955
What did you want? That we send you a homing pigeon?

16
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,165
Ha ha ha ha! You wouldn't have belived us.

17
00:01:58,884 --> 00:01:59,912
Uh... Biste.

18
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:01,936
You should take care of these two.

19
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:05,256
Oh! I forgot about them!

20
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:09,748
It's your fault, you know well that I can't do two things at the same time.

21
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,076
Sorry my friend, no mouth to mouth to the old mutt.

22
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,637
Midge is very jealous!

23
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:18,192
*Cough*

24
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:19,076
Ah...

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,608
And to think that we had finally found a way for him to shut his big mouth.

26
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:25,740
But no, here he is again.

27
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:28,100
Eh, go impale yourself.

28
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:46,012
Again.

29
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,973
Are you serious you two?

30
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:58,480
Oh my Bibi! Oh yes my Bibi! Make love with me!

31
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:00,215
Right away, crazy boy!

32
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:06,590
Dogs in heat, that's what you are!

33
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:09,645
Come on, we're leaving Agard.

34
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:12,691
When they start, it is better to be far away.

35
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:15,309
They can be very primitive.

36
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:17,277
But? Son?

37
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:18,637
What are you doing?

38
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:22,440
This is the first time I get to draw this kind of scene.

39
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,322
Ah but what the...

40
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,174
I... But I...

41
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:30,244
Sure.

42
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:53,496
It's here. Do you remember, Lance?

43
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,676
Mmmhm... Vaguely.

44
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:03,082
Thanks, my love.

45
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:05,106
You saved me again.

46
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:08,168
That's normal, Cadence.

47
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:11,543
Uhm... Say...

48
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,567
Do you really know where you are going?

49
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,606
The kingdom of your mother isn't too far away.

50
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,630
We are at the right place, son.

51
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:22,215
Right, all we have to do now is get to the zaap.

52
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:25,418
But to do that, we need to traverse this fault.

53
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,496
AAAH!

54
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,918
Ha ha ha ha! Are we going or are we waiting for the grass to grow?

55
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:36,512
I'm ready.

56
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:42,395
Good, cover up and let's get started before I forget the way.

57
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:13,631
Mmhm... This damn black molasses.

58
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:16,241
Agard, do not step on it.

59
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:21,288
The black molasses... These damned greek birds...

60
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:23,101
We should be very careful!

61
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,765
We shouldn't draw the attention of these damn volatiles.

62
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:30,183
We should run as if death was on our heels.

63
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,036
Run!

64
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:58,036
Don't worry, I'll disperse them!

65
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,896
Old one-eyed Iop ! You don't know how to aim anymore?

66
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:08,474
Aah! It's not as it used to be!

67
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:11,980
Come on! Hurry up! Let's head to the forest!

68
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:15,347
Come on, faster! Faster! Faster!

69
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:17,557
Hah! He's funny!

70
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:20,058
Did he not see the size of my legs?

71
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:21,129
Mouche!

72
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:22,543
I can't do it anymore!

73
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:24,439
Come on! Climb!

74
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,689
You are so strong, my Bibi...

75
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:32,212
Always for you, my midge.

76
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:34,142
Come on! You beasts!

77
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,166
Uncle Mouche is back!

78
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,777
Be careful!

79
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:02,815
Woah !

80
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:13,617
Huh ?

81
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,336
Oh... My sharpshooter...

82
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,453
Heh heh heh... You naughty girl.

83
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,203
Agard! Wait for us, Agard!

84
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:30,836
Agard!

85
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:33,446
Do not walk toward the black molasses!

86
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:46,369
AAAH!

87
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,424
Aaah! Amazing! A cave!

88
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,182
Agard! Wait!

89
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:59,401
-I see light! There's something shiny!

90
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:02,306
Gold! Precious stones!

91
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:04,268
And a giant gem!

92
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:06,292
Cadence! Don't touch anything!

93
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:08,135
We didn't came for that!

94
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:26,523
Hey, friends?

95
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,445
But... There has never been so many!

96
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:32,476
HEY! FRIENDS!

97
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,992
In 40 years, the victims probably multiplied!

98
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,672
Turn around, you bunch of scums!

99
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:54,859
We must continue to move forward!

100
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,492
They are too many!

101
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:59,834
Aaaaaah!!

102
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:03,031
Agard! Don't touch anything!

103
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:05,500
Out of my way!

104
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,099
Where is Agard?

105
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:41,451
Where is my son?

106
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:43,584
My poor heart...

107
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:44,685
What a run...

108
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,021
Agard! Above all, don't touch anything!
