1
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,899
Birthday

2
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,533
Belladone...

3
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:22,133
Father! You will have a beautiful day
for your birthday!

4
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:24,633
Huh?

5
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,766
You spent the night outside again.

6
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:34,799
You’re 70 years old and you still act like a child.

7
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:38,199
Huh?

8
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:39,566
Father?

9
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,266
Father!

10
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:43,299
This isn’t funny.

11
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:45,233
Wake up!

12
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:47,299
Heroes of Albuera...

13
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,899
Accept my father on your sides.

14
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:53,866
He was one of the best warriors...
-One of the best warriors?

15
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,166
Hah!

16
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:58,166
I was the best.

17
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:07,133
It’s the third time you play dead this week!

18
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:10,133
And everytime, you fall for it.

19
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,033
I will serve you your fortifying.

20
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:15,033
I already told you it gave me colics.

21
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,833
Of course, brave warrior.

22
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,933
But remind me how you are you going to
go down the thousands of steps

23
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,599
which leads to the throne room?

24
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:28,499
You see.

25
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,533
I don’t need anything.

26
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:34,299
And it’s with dignity
and without shitting myself

27
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:38,233
that I’ll celebrate my 70th birthday

28
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,066
among my subjects.

29
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:55,433
Come on, go join your wife with the others.

30
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,466
See you later.

31
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,966
Count Lance Dur!

32
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,866
Lord and protector of Albuera!

33
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:50,999
Lance dur!

34
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,999
Look who is showing off!

35
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:57,833
You bunch of animal furriers!

36
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,633
You pitiful dust licker, fake friends!

37
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,999
Do I need to be on my deathbed
for you guys take the time to

38
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:07,566
go see me?

39
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:10,133
We were told that it was your funeral.

40
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:13,099
Otherwise, we wouldn’t have 
travelled all the way here!

41
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:16,199
Boh, I guess we just have to leave then!

42
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,533
Welcome, you bunch of idiots!

43
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,233
Thank you, good people of Albuera.

44
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,499
May love be with you

45
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:35,499
and let the festivities begin!

46
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:54,666
For your birthday, sir,
I specially reinforced the end!

47
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,766
Thanks, but what’s the purpose?

48
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,066
At your venerable age,

49
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:03,533
It seems that we often have trouble to
relief ourselves further than our toes.

50
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,333
With that, you will keep your feet dry!

51
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:12,366
By Crâ, Lance!
Your subjects are not fools!

52
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:15,366
They know that you’re now
just an old weak crust!

53
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:21,033
A gift from the three of us, old brother.

54
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:22,733
Hell’s teeth!

55
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:29,999
-It is stunning.
-And retractable above all.

56
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:33,299
Adjusted to the correct size,
It can serve you as a cane!

57
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,166
Grandpa!

58
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:39,232
Grandpa, happy birthday!

59
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,266
I did it, all alone!

60
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,666
It’s beautiful, my wild blueberry.

61
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,999
-I know!

62
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:47,999
And I think it suits you really well!

63
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:51,199
You have a lot of talent, my small Ozie.

64
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,232
-Happy birthday, father!

65
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:56,599
It’s a painting of you and Ozie.

66
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:58,732
Thank you son.
It looks nice.

67
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:00,866
I will put it with the others.

68
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:05,699
Once again, you lost months trying
to please this old idiot.

69
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,699
I am old but I hear you Isalt.

70
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:11,732
If you want to express yourself,
don’t hold it.

71
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:15,332
No, Isalt just wanted to say that-

72
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:18,199
-That I’m just an old idiot that
know nothing about art?

73
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,666
It’s certain, I spent more time
on the roads than in museums.

74
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,166
-His eyes...
-I saw Bibi, it’s going to be horrible.

75
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:30,932
Which still has the merit of offering
you all a certain comfort!

76
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,432
-Don’t use your loud voice grandpa!

77
00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:36,432
You will scare everyone again!

78
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:43,366
Hmmm, your mom is right my blueberry.
I’m just an old idiot.

79
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:46,232
It’s ok that you’re
old and an idiot grandpa!

80
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:48,232
I still love you.

81
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:10,699
Belladone!

82
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,699
I recognised your magic!

83
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:15,166
Huh? Mother?

84
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:31,032
No! Ozie!

85
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:38,099
You must be the small Ozie.

86
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,099
You have the same eyes as your grandfather.

87
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,099
I was thinking a lot about you
these past few years.

88
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,066
Happy birthday my love!

89
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:53,966
You don’t taste quite the same.

90
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:54,932
I-

91
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,232
No! My son!

92
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:08,732
Father!

93
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:11,266
Ozie! She took Ozie!

94
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,899
W-We have to find her!

95
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:15,832
Father! Are you listening?

96
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:20,832
Ozie! My blueberry!
Gards! Take care of everyone here!

97
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,066
The passage of time
wreaks havoc on some people.

98
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,432
Forget about the leggings, won’t you?

99
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,099
Have mercy on us,
but we need to hurry.

100
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:50,732
No matter what you say, Lance,

101
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:53,732
But your son is really good at painting.

102
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:57,466
Yeah, it’s not the most useful things
at the current times.

103
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:01,266
Anyway, your ex is always the same.

104
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:04,432
I didn’t saw her since
Agard’s birth.

105
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:07,499
I don’t understand what she wants from me,
but we are going to see her.

106
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:09,099
and she will give back the kids!

107
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,199
So, how do we turn this thing into a cane?

108
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,199
-Here, there’s a small button.

109
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:19,966
Ah, technology.
It’s complicated nowaday.

110
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,799
But! What are you doing?

111
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:25,099
What do you think?

112
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:27,566
You will never survive without us!

113
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,699
-I’m also coming!

114
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,966
Ozie is my daughter, please, father.
I will try to not bother you.

115
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:42,566
And I took your fortifying potions.

116
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:46,732
Good.

117
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:49,866
Let’s go! Let’s find my wild blueberry!

118
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:57,666
My friends,

119
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,666
after you.
