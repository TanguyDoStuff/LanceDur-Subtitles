Do you smell that, friends?

3
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,094
Your smell of wet mutt?

4
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:47,246
No, you one-eyed Iop.

5
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:49,219
The smell of adventure!

6
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:57,898
If someone told me I would relive this before I die...

7
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:00,202

This is the seasickness ou the performance of our minstrels that make you sick?

24
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,592
The mix of both, I suppose...

25
00:01:57,342 --> 00:01:58,213
Say, father.

26
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,303
Do you think that Ozie and the kids are fine?

27
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:03,972
The intents of your mothers have always been indecipherable.

28
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,400
You never wanted to talk to me about her, father.

29
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,619
This is maybe the right time, no?

30
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:17,083
Once you spent a year with such a woman,

31
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,763
you cannot love another one.

32
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:22,372
Your mother broke my heart by abandoning us, Agard.

33
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:25,167
There is nothing good to tell on this subject.

34
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,384
But why kidnap your own grand daughter?

35
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:30,687
Why? Why? WHY?

36
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,263
I don't know!

37
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:36,616
The mystery is part of her charm, what do you want me to say?

38
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:39,566
First of all, you can tell me what she did 40 years ago,

39
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,336
et why you both fighted.

40
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:43,064
Uuh...

41
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:45,091
Lance, you don't remember?

42
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,094
Dammit!

43
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,936
Ah...

44
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,764
Mouche ! Where are you my love?

45
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:41,698
I am here, my Bibi!

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,164
Ouch! My eye!

47
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:46,015
I don't have any more after that!

48
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:49,450
Do not scare me like that, my midge!

49
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:51,321
-And me?!

50
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:53,104
Nobody is worried?!

51
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,378
Belladone...

52
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,588
Do whatever you want, my love.

53
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:35,620
You know that no matter the challenges, I always achieve my goals.

54
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:41,054
Father, do you have any ideas of what awaits us?

55
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,045
Yes my son. Adventure and danger, just the way I like them.

56
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:51,540
We will never pass, we are completely surrounded.

57
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:56,490
No, my old mutt. I know her, she just tried to slow us down.

58
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,518
Well she succeed, how are we going to get out of here?

59
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,459
Agard.

60
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,696
You will be able to make yourself useful, my son.

61
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,577
You will look to see where the nearest rocky point is.

62
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,687
I will what?

63
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:12,818
Biste.

64
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:14,077
Lance.

65
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:17,576
No no no NO NO NO NO!

66
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:19,406
Wait! I'm not ready!

67
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:22,146
Coming through!

68
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:24,983
AAAAAAAAAAAH !!

69
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:34,196
Don't miss your reception, Biste.

70
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:35,379
-aaaaAAAAH!

71
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:38,132
Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-You'll never do that again, right?

72
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:39,336
You bunch of loutish!

73
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:41,321
Yes, promise. So?

74
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,710
About a hundred meters away.

75
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,203
A hundred meters?

76
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:47,102
Mmhm... It's going to be tense.

77
00:05:47,102 --> 00:05:49,150
I will need a vial, Agard.

78
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:51,771
But I already gave you one this morning.

79
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:53,071
Are you sure that-

80
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,619
-Agard, please.

81
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,400
Very good.

82
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,831
This is the last one, father.

83
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:07,511
Biste, Chaille, do a diversion in the opposite direction.

84
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:09,645
Mouche, cover me if things go wrong.

85
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:14,974
70 years old and he's still as nuts as before.

86
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,506
Ah, that's why we love him.

87
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:29,413
I never fought this kind of fish.

88
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:30,522
There's a start to everything!

89
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,484
Even for elderly like us.

90
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:06,530
The way is clear.

91
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,085
Mouche !

92
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:08,125
He he !

93
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,084
Lance, it's your turn.

94
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:55,392
No, it's impossible.

95
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,291
Don't tell me you know what he was about to do!

96
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,826
Oh, we've known your father for so long.

97
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:01,193
-He's mad!

98
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:03,152
There are hundreds of them!

99
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:05,136
How will he get out of this? He can't manage to-

100
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:06,605
-It's going to be ok.

101
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:08,637
It wasn't supposed to happen like that.

102
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,072
My boy.

103
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:16,485
Trust us. Your father will not leave us like this.

104
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,934
This is it! Get on the boat! Quick!

105
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:36,813
Oof!

106
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,074
But... How did he do it?

107
00:08:39,697 --> 00:08:42,230
You have so much to learn about your old man.

108
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,296
Come on! Everyone aboard!

109
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:06,829
HA HA HA HA HA HA !

110
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:09,115
No no no no no no! I'm slipping! I'M SLIPPING!

111
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:13,742
Hii!
AAAAAH!

112
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:14,745
Catch!

113
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,291
Yah! Stupid fish!

114
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:43,627
HA HA HA HA HA !

115
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:45,998
Pull harder! Old carp!

116
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:48,527
We're not going to spend the day like that!

117
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:52,726
-Oh! You didn't lost everything in your arms, old goat!

118
00:09:55,117 --> 00:09:57,780
Isn't your little game over yet?

119
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:00,912
There is no game, it's Bibi the strongest!

120
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:04,368
We're all going to die!
We're all going to die!

121
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:05,584
AAAAAAAAH !!

122
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:07,663
One more!
Ha ha !

123
00:10:07,663 --> 00:10:11,115
Come on! Pull harder, old debris!

124
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,565
Ya ha ha ha ha !

125
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:16,182
Ha ha ha ha ha !!

126
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,102
I missed it so much!

127
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:20,642
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !!
